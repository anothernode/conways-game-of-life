# Conway's Game of Life

My crude take on implementing [Conway's Game of
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a part of my
journey to learn proper use of JavaScript. Have a look at it running [in
action](http://home.anothernode.com/conway).

It's an [exercise](http://eloquentjavascript.net/18_http.html#i_XyKQVmCbTN) in
the marvelous book [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net). There's
a sample solution of the author himself, Marijn Haverbeke, [in the
book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#18.3) and also [on
GitHub](https://github.com/marijnh/Eloquent-JavaScript/blob/master/code/solutions/18_3_conways_game_of_life.html).
